# Assignment 1 - Task 3 Essay

## Motivation for Learning Bioinformatics 

My main motivation for learning bioinformatics is that these skills will be critical for both my 
master's thesis and overall career. This is a weakness in my knowledge and skill base and in order 
to perform the data analyses that I need to do to create a complete and effective project, I will 
need to be able to work with an HPC and understand how to build pipelines from the command line. 

## Goals for the Course

My goals are to become proficient at building pipelines and learning how to work with HPC 
clusters because come next fall, I will be doing that extensively with my research. I want to be 
proficient enough to be able to teach it to someone else, as that to me is proof of true mastery
of a skill. I also am excited to get to know the people in the class because I feel like we all 
come from different areas of expertise. 

## Plan of Attack for Learning 

I aim to follow very closely in class and with each assignment. I also plan on using ChatGPT for 
help when I do not understand something. I will not be using it to do anything for me because 
frankly I will never learn anything by doing that. However, I have found so far that when I am 
stuck conceptually it has been a useful tool. The class has also made a groupchat that I aim to 
utilize when I am confused or need help. I know that at the end of the day however, this class 
is just going to take diligence and hard work and I am prepared to do that because I really want 
to learn this information and skill. 

## Folder Structure 

The folder structure I created is good for reproducible research because it is easy to follow 
and easy to locate files. Everything is clearly labeled with names that make sense and are in 
the correct directories. If someone else were to look at my folder structure, it would be both 
easy to understand and easy to navigate. 

## Importance of Documented Code

I believe that we use documented code for bioinformatics research tasks because it allows the work 
to be reproducible. Documenting everything you do within coding is critical for both your future 
self and others to be able to look back and see exactly what you did, both to fix any potential 
errors and to recreate your path/pipeline. 

## Other information 

The only thing I would say that is important for you to know is that I am quite literally starting
at ground zero. The most I knew coming into this class (which I learned basically 3 weeks ago) 
was vaguely how to operate within a terminal, so things like 'ls' 'cd' 'pwd', simple stuff like 
that. I recognize that this is going to be a steep learning curve for me, but I also think that 
this class is the best way I learn this stuff, rather than me teaching myself or having to take 
away time from lab work to learn how to do this in a year's time.
